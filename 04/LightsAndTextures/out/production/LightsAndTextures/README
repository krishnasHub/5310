Assignment 4

=========================================
#PROGRAM FEATURES

KEYS:
Keys that operate as the previous assignment:
"W" and "S" to nod up/down
Up/Down arrow keys to move forward/backward
Left/Right arrow keys to turn left/right
New keys for this assignment:
"1": Toggles on/off the light in the first room (to the left when starting the program.
This has multiple maces in it.
"2": Toggles on/off the light in the second room (to the right) with mjolnir/Thor's hammer.
"3": Toggles on/off the light in the main room (with table, new model/object).

LIGHTS:
In addition to the three lights just mentioned, there are additional ones in the hallway
that cannot be toggled on/off. Lights are implemented as an additional node in the scenegraph.
They are parsed from the xml files as the other objects instances are. Whether or not
it is a spotlight is determined by the spotangle.

NEW MODEL/OBJECT:
The DaVinci Helicopter features two rotating gears, as well as spinning blades. Connected
to each gear are shafts/cranks connected to the overall frame/platforms. On top of
the platform is a humanoid hanging onto a support beam and waving. The gear alone has
well over 10 object instances (each tooth is a box instance) as well the higher-level
structure of the helicopter.  This flies above the table in the third room.

ANIMATIONS:
Second Room:
The mjolnir rotates, spinning on its head.

Third room:
The DaVinci Helicopter has gears (and its corresponding shafts/cranks rotating).
The two gears rotate on two different axises, and the spinning blades rotate on the same
axis as one of the gears (at different speeds for visual effect). As mentioned,
the humanoid is waving. The mjolnir flies around the table, while rotating. The mace spins
stationary on the table.


=========================================
#ADDITIONAL FEATURE
Textures were also implemented in this program (not required by assignment). The texture
that each object has is defined in the xml files, and parsed through the XML parser. Images
for each texture are located in the ./textures/ folder.

#EXTRA CREDIT

The video file is located in output/images, called out.mp4.
It can also be downloaded at found at: https://github.com/ajesguerra/webdev-esguerra-arnold/blob/master/src/assets/projectimages/out.mp4

Each time the video runs, it will re-capture up to 500 images into the ./output/images folder.
